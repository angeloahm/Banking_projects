# üè¶ Banking Projects Repository

## Overview ‚ú®

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks designed to automate the ingestion, processing, and preliminary analysis of banking data from the FDIC. The project focuses on two primary datasets: Call Reports and the Summary of Deposits (SOD). The repository is organized into folders for data dictionaries and code, making it easier for collaborators and users to understand and extend the work.

## Repository Structure üìÇ

- **Dictionaries/**  
  Contains FDIC data dictionaries (with hyperlinks to original sources to be added).

- **codes/**  
  Contains all project code:
  - **ingest_CR.py**: Ingests Call Report schedules for a given date and saves them as CSV.
  - **construct_main_df.py**: Merges individual CSV files into a consolidated "call_reports.csv".
  - **cr_analysis.ipynb**: Analyzes "call_reports.csv", defining key financial variables using schedules FFIEC 031 & 041.
  - **ingest_SOD.py**: Ingests Summary of Deposits (SOD) data from the FDIC.
  - **preliminary_SOD.ipynb**: Performs preliminary analysis on SOD data.
  - **Load_SOD.py**: Experimental script for loading SOD data via an API.

## Folder & File Descriptions üìù

### Dictionaries üìö

- **Purpose:** Contains data dictionaries obtained from the FDIC website.
- **Note:** While the exact source links are not currently embedded, hyperlinks will be added so users can directly reference the original FDIC sources.

### codes üíª

This folder hosts all the code necessary for data ingestion, processing, and initial analysis.

- **ingest_CR.py**  
  Reads all the schedules of interest from the Call Reports for a specified date and exports the data as a CSV file named with the corresponding date.
  
- **construct_main_df.py**  
  Combines the individual CSV files generated by `ingest_CR.py` into a single file named `call_reports.csv`.

- **cr_analysis.ipynb**  
  Processes the consolidated `call_reports.csv` file to define key financial variables (such as Deposits, Loans, Assets, etc.). This notebook uses data from schedules FFIEC 031 and 041 (dependent on the bank) to construct these variables and perform an initial analysis.

- **ingest_SOD.py**  
  Similar to `ingest_CR.py`, this script focuses on ingesting the Summary of Deposits (SOD) data from the FDIC.

- **preliminary_SOD.ipynb**  
  Reads the CSV file generated by `ingest_SOD.py` and conducts a preliminary analysis on the SOD data.

- **Load_SOD.py**  
  An experimental script intended to load SOD data using an API.

## How to Use üöÄ

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Download the 'Call Reports Single Period' files from: This script downloads the Call Reports Single Period data from [this link](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/pws/downloadbulkdata.aspx).
   - Run `ingest_CR.py` to collect Call Reports schedules for your chosen date. 
   - Run `ingest_SOD.py` to collect the Summary of Deposits data.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Execute `construct_main_df.py` to merge individual CSV files into a single `call_reports.csv`.
   - Open `cr_analysis.ipynb` to process `call_reports.csv`, construct financial variables, and perform a preliminary analysis of Call Reports data.
   - Open `preliminary_SOD.ipynb` for a preliminary analysis of the SOD data.

3. **API Loading (Experimental):**
   - Use `Load_SOD.py` for testing the API-based approach to load SOD data.

## Dependencies üì¶

- **Python 3.x**  
- Required packages (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.)  
  _Make sure to install the necessary packages via `pip` or your preferred package manager. A requirements file may be added in the future for convenience._
